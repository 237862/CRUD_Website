# CRUD_Website
CRUD

My website lets any user to import their name, the sport they play, and their age. It collects all the entries and puts them into a table.

# Features

One of the features of my website is the find info button allows the user to view who is in the database.

# Languages used

I used Javascript, Html, CSS, and PHP. Javascript was used for the pop-up, Html was used to set up the look of the website, CSS gave it color and font styles, and PHP was the brain for the entire website. PHP contained the Create, Read, Upload, and Delete files.

# How it was made

The website was created by using html to set up the look of my website. I used CSS to make the background purple. I coded in Javascript to show the "information loading" pop up. I used PHP to make the website function like it was intended to. It worked like the brains of the entire website.
